ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Braxton Jonesâ€”a web developer with a passion for turning complex ideas into user-friendly solutions. Currently learning Go to break away from Javascript (finally), I'm always on the lookout for new opportunities to build innovative projects. 

My toolkit includes:  
- **Frontend:** React, CSS, JavaScript, NextJS, TailwindCSS  
- **State Management:** Zustand, Redux  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express  
- **Testing:** Jest, Cypress, Vitest, React Testing Library  
- **Database:** Postgres, SQLite, MongoDB, Prisma, DrizzleORM, GraphQL  

Iâ€™m particularly excited by anything that combines music and coding. If you have a cool project or just want to chat about building better products, feel free to reach out!
