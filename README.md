ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Braxton Jonesâ€”a web developer passionate about turning complex ideas into user-friendly, real-world applications.

I'm actively coding solutions that solve everyday problems, with the goal of landing a role where I can both contribute and grow. This would allow me to spend more time researching intersections between music and technology, my true passion! From audio-reactive visuals to sound synthesis tools, Iâ€™m driven by the idea of combining music and code to create innovative, interactive experiences.
My toolkit includes:

    Frontend: React, CSS, JavaScript, NextJS, TailwindCSS
    State Management: Zustand, Redux
    Backend: Node.js, Express
    Testing: Jest, Cypress, Vitest, React Testing Library
    Database: Postgres, SQLite, MongoDB, Prisma, DrizzleORM, GraphQL

Iâ€™m always excited to collaborate on projects, especially those that bridge music and technology. If you're working on something cool or just want to chat about building better products, letâ€™s connect!
