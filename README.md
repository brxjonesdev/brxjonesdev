Hi, Iâ€™m **Braxton Jones** ðŸ‘‹  
A software developer based in the **DMV area (D.C., Maryland, Virginia)**.

Iâ€™m passionate about building software that empowers creators. My current focus is on combining DSP and electronic music theory with modern web technologies like **React** and **Rust (WebAssembly)** to create fast, interactive, and scalable audio tools.

Some of my key projects and interests include:  
- Designing modular synths and custom oscillators in the browser  
- Building a music-focused component library based on **shadcn**  
- Creating interactive signal processing playgrounds for learning and teaching DSP concepts  
- Developing filter and envelope visualizers for sound design exploration

#### What Iâ€™m Looking For  
- Any roles where I can apply and grow my skills in React, Rust, and software development  
- Opportunities to contribute to meaningful projects, whether in frontend or backend development
